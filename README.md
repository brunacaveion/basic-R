# basic-R
 Some basic codes in Rstudio for data analysis, such as filter rows and columns in a table, filter subtables, add a new column, etc.
You can find all the explanations you need in the code.

 In this document, we use the library tidyverse and some functions, such as filter(), slice(), mean(), sum(), min(), max(), nrow() and rep().

 The functions mean(), sum(), min(), max() are mathematical functions to calculate the mean, sum, minimum and maximum in a dataframe column in this order.
 
 nrow() function help us to calculate the number of rows in a table, and rep() we use to repete the argument we choose the number of times we choose.
